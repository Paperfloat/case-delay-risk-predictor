# case-delay-risk-predictor
A resource-planning tool that flags cases at risk of indefinite delay, built on public eCourts/NJDG data — with fairness and drift monitoring as first-class requirements, not afterthoughts.
## Target Definition & Known Limitations
- Target: days between date_of_filing and date_of_decision
- v1 scope: only cases with a recorded decision date are used for training
  (~11% of Delhi 2012 cases are still pending and excluded)
- Planned v2 improvement: treat pending cases as right-censored
  (survival analysis / classification-style risk bucketing) instead of dropping them
